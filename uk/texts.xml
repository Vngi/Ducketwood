<editor_welcome><![CDATA[<font size="24">HOW TO SHOOT YOUR MOVIE</font><br><br>Okay! You've got a brilliant title for your movie and selected the actors... Now it's time to shoot your movie!<br>This is how it works:<br><br><font face="HabboTwelve Bold">1. </font> SET: Select the set, furni props and music you want for your movie;<br><font face="HabboTwelve Bold">2. </font>ACTION: Drag and drop action elements (for example, speech bubbles and sound effects) to the timeline boxes;<br><font face="HabboTwelve Bold">3. </font>SPEECH: Fill up the speech bubbles with dialogue;<br><font face="HabboTwelve Bold">4. </font>NEW SCENES: Add or delete scenes;<br><font face="HabboTwelve Bold">5. </font>PREVIEW AND SAVE: Preview and save, or edit again and save, the movie you made;<br><font face="HabboTwelve Bold">6. </font>DELETE STUFF: Delete action elements by dragging & dropping them to trash can<br><br>QUESTIONS? <u><a href='asfunction:_parent.openInstructions'>Check out the instructions</a></u>]]></editor_welcome>

<editor_continue><![CDATA[Continue]]></editor_continue>
<ins_1><![CDATA[<font face="HabboTwelve Bold">TIMELINES AND ACTION ELEMENTS</font><br>There's six timelines: Sound effects, lights, surprise element and three timelines for actors (one for each actor). Use the controls on the left to select the action element you want to add, and then drag and drop the selected action element to a timeline. You can remove action elements by dragging & dropping them to the trash can.<br><br>The timeline is split into frames. You can view one frame at the time by clicking the timeline (the selected frame is displayed in the preview area).<br><br>The timeline defines the order of actions. EXAMPLE: If you want your actor to first say "Burp!" and then dance, you have to: 1) Drag & drop one speech bubble and one dance action element to his/her timeline; 2) Then edit the text in the speech bubble and fill it with your "Burp!" (you can edit the text later by clicking the speech bubble). To make him dance for two frames, drag&drop two dance elements and place them side by side on the timeline.<br><br>Surprise elements will disappear and the lights turn back on unless if you fill all the frames till the end with the selected effect. For example, if you want a crocodile to be visible all the time, you need to have nine crocodiles in the timeline, one in every frame.<br><br>Tip: Remember to preview the scene and watch the changes in action before saving the movie!]]></ins_1>

<ins_2><![CDATA[<font face="HabboTwelve Bold">SET, FURNI AND MUSIC</font><br>You can change the set, furni, and music. Just use the controls next to the preview area to choose the ones you want. The Randomize button randomly selects the set, furni and music for you.]]></ins_2>

<ins_3><![CDATA[<font face="HabboTwelve Bold">THE MOVIE SCENES</font><br>Your movie is made of scenes: Scenes are the blocks or parts into which a movie is divided. Scenes are listed at the bottom of the editor. To add a scene, click "Add new scene" button; to delete a scene, click the "X" in the scene icon.<br><br>You can edit a scene any time: just select the scene by clicking its icon. Each scene can have a different set, music, action elements, etc.]]></ins_3>

<ins_4><![CDATA[<font face="HabboTwelve Bold">PLAY & SAVE YOUR MOVIE</font><br>You can play and save your movie by clicking the "Play / save" button. After playing the movie, you can return to the editor to continue editing. ]]></ins_4>
